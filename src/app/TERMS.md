# Terms of Service

Last updated August 2, 2023

Please read these Terms of Service (“Agreement” or “Terms”) carefully. Your use or access of the Site (as defined below) constitutes your consent to this Agreement. **This Agreement is between you and DeXter, together with its subsidiaries and affiliates, (“DeXter”, “we”, “our” or “us”)**, operators of the DeXter digital asset platform (“IDEX” or “Site”) currently available at **ourwebsite.url** and applies to your:

- use of DeXter to buy or sell digital assets;
- use of any other services offered by us (together, the “Services”).

This Agreement hereby incorporates by this reference any additional terms and conditions with respect to the Site or Services, posted by DeXter to the Site, or otherwise made available to you by DeXter, including without limitation, during the creation, acquisition, transfer, or modification of certain digital assets, our online and/or mobile services, and software provided on or in connection with those services.

If you are an individual accessing or using the Site or Services on behalf of, or for the benefit of, any corporation, partnership or other entity with which you are associated (“Organization”), then you are agreeing to this Agreement on behalf of yourself and such Organization, and you represent and warrant that you have the legal authority to bind such Organization to this Agreement. References to “you” and “your” in this Agreement will refer to both the individual using the Site or Services and to any such Organization.

THIS AGREEMENT CONTAINS A BINDING ARBITRATION CLAUSE AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER THAT IMPACT YOUR RIGHTS ABOUT HOW TO RESOLVE DISPUTES. PLEASE READ IT CAREFULLY.

THE SERVICES ARE NOT BEING OFFERED TO PERSONS WHO ARE LOCATED OR HAVE THEIR PLACE OF RESIDENCE IN ANY RESTRICTED JURISDICTIONS.

## Description of Services

We provide a convenient platform for buying and selling digital assets on the Radix network. **Users deposit their digital assets to the AlphaDEX smart contract,** and, through the Site, authorize Radix transactions to buy and sell those assets for other assets on the Radix network. Users may use our platform to buy and sell digital assets using the AlphaDEX smart contract. Our Services do not allow Users to buy and sell their assets for anything other than assets on the Radix network. That means we do not support the conversion of fiat currency to digital assets, or vice versa.

**We charge a transaction fee for the trade (and/or execution of an order both Market or Limit) to maintain the platform and the services offered. The gas fee or network fee for order execution (including cancelling of orders) to the Radix network is passed on to the user having full control and transparency of the Radix network fees before executing an order.**

DeXter is a non-custodial platform. This means we do not own, control, or take custody of any digital assets held by Users on the platform. Users maintain custody over their digital assets at all times.

## General Information

By accessing or using the Services, you agree that you have read, understood and accept all of the terms and conditions contained in this Agreement as well as our Privacy Policy. You also represent that you have the legal authority to accept these Terms on behalf of yourself and any party you represent in connection with your use of the Services. If you are an individual who is entering into these Terms on behalf of an entity, you represent and warrant that you have the power to bind that entity, and you hereby agree on that entity’s behalf to be bound by these Terms, with the terms “you”, and “your” applying to you, that entity, and other users accessing the Services on behalf of that entity.

We may, in our sole and absolute discretion, without liability to you or any third-party, refuse to let you use of one or more of the Services. Such actions may be taken as a result of a number of factors, including without limitation legal/regulatory demand, or your violation of the terms of this Agreement. We may also temporarily suspend your access to the Services if a technical problem so requires.

## Security of your Account and Wallet

We are not an insured financial institution. As a result, unlike funds held in most banks or credit unions, amounts displayed through the Services are not insured against loss.

Furthermore, DeXter is a non-custodial platform. As such, we do not know nor have access to the private keys to the digital asset wallets you use in connection with the Services (“Wallets”). Therefore, you are exclusively responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and security of your Accounts or devices you use to access the Services. You are also responsible for maintaining the security of the digital asset wallets you utilize in connection with the Services, and for ensuring that no unauthorized person has access to your wallet files, its private keys, or any device that you utilize in connection with the Services.

We will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to protect your Account or your Wallets.

It is your sole responsibility to provide accurate information for creation and maintenance of your account. You are solely responsible for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of all information and materials that you provide to use in connection with your use of the Site or Services. This includes, but is not limited to, all information and materials that you provide to us in connection with background checks and identity verification. You represent and warrant that (i) all such information and materials are true, accurate, and complete in all respects, comply with applicable law and do not violate or infringe any third-party rights; and (ii) you will immediately notify us about, and correct, and inaccuracy in any such materials or information.

## Trading Terms

We provide Users with a platform that allows orders they enter to be connected with the orders of other Users. Orders may be partially filled or may be filled by a number of orders, depending on the trading activity at the time an order is placed.

A transaction on DeXter may fail for several reasons, including without limitation a change in prices, order availability, or technical difficulties experienced by us or Nodes. We make no representation or warrant that any transaction will be executed fully, or at all. We are, under no circumstances, liable for any loss or injury suffered by a failure of a transaction to complete properly or in a timely manner, including dispatching to the Radix Network. Further, we are in no way responsible for notifying you of a transaction failure, although you are able to see any such failures on the Site. You have full responsibility to determine and inquire into the failure of any transaction which you initiate.

The digital assets that are available for purchase through the Services may be subject to high or low transaction volume, liquidity issues, and volatility for potentially extended periods. WE MAY ALSO DELIST AN ASSET FROM TRADING ON DeXter AT ANY TIME, FOR ANY REASON, WITHOUT PRIOR NOTICE. You acknowledge that while we are using commercially reasonable methods to provide trading availability and pricing data to you through our Services, we do not guarantee that the Services will be consistently available. You agree that you assume all risks and potential losses associated with digital assets being delisted, price fluctuations, or differences in actual versus indicated prices.

We operate as a platform provider and generally do not act as principal or counterparty with respect to trades entered into on the platform. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) we may act as a counterparty for limited trades made for the purpose of liquidating fees collected on User trades, and (ii) our affiliates or partners may execute trades on the platform.

## Prohibited Activity

In connection with your use of the Site and/or Services, you will not:

Notwithstanding the foregoing, and subject to compliance with applicable law and any instructions posted in the robots.txt file located in the Site’s root directory, DeXter grants to the operators of public search engines permission to use spiders to copy materials from the Site for the sole purpose of (and solely to the extent necessary for) creating publicly available, searchable indices of such materials, but not caches or archives of such materials. DeXter reserves the right to revoke such permission either generally or in specific cases, at any time and without notice.

- Post, transmit or otherwise make available through or in connection with the Site or Services any virus, worm, Trojan horse, Easter egg, time bomb, spyware, ransomware, malware, or other computer code, file or program that is or is potentially harmful or invasive or intended to damage or hijack the operation of, or to monitor the use of, any hardware, software or equipment.
- Otherwise attempt to gain unauthorized access to or use of the Site, the API, other Accounts, Nodes, or computer systems connected to the Site; or
- Engage in any behavior which violates this Agreement or is otherwise deemed unacceptable by us in our sole discretion.

## Reservation of Rights

DeXter reserves the right to bar any transactions on the Site, for or with, any user with or without cause, at any time, subject to any limitations imposed by applicable law. In lieu of refusing access to the Site or Services, DeXter may, in its sole and absolute discretion, perform due diligence. You may be subject to due diligence procedures in your use of the Site or Services. If you decline to provide requested information or otherwise do not reply timely or substantively with the documentation or data requested, DeXter has the absolute discretion to immediately suspend or terminate your Account.

## Intellectual Property Rights

The Site and its entire contents, features, and functionality (including but not limited to all information, software, text, displays, images, video, and audio, and the design, selection, and arrangement thereof), are owned by DeXter, its licensors, or other providers.

DeXter’s name and all related names, logos, product and service names, designs, and slogans are trademarks of DeXter, its associates, or licensors (collectively, “Associates”). You must not use such marks without the prior written permission of DeXter. All other names, logos, product and service names, designs, and slogans on this Site are the trademarks of their respective owners.

DeXter reserves all rights not expressly granted to you in this section. Accordingly, nothing in this Agreement or on the Site will be construed as granting to you, by implication, estoppel or otherwise, any additional license rights in and to the Site or any DeXter intellectual property located or displayed on or within the Site.

## Risk Disclosures

Trading digital assets is risky and you should never trade more than they can afford to lose. The following list of risks associated with digital assets and the Services is not exhaustive.

### Risks of trading in digital assets

Digital asset prices are highly volatile and trading in digital assets is extremely risky. In addition, factors beyond our control may affect market liquidity for a particular digital asset, such as regulatory activity, market manipulation, the acts or omissions of the issuer of the digital asset, or unexplainable price volatility. We may also determine it is in the best interest of Users to suspend trading in a digital asset for these reasons. By using the Services, you accept the risk of trading digital assets. In entering into any transaction, you represent that you have been, are, and will be solely responsible for making your own independent appraisal into the risks of the transaction and the underlying digital asset.

Our listing of a digital asset does not indicate approval or disapproval of the digital asset’s merits as an investment or a technology. We give no warranty as to the suitability of the digital asset traded under this Agreement and assume no fiduciary duty in our relations with you. You must conduct your own due diligence when determining whether to buy or sell a particular digital asset. If you choose wisely, we will not share in any portion of your gains. Likewise, if you choose poorly, we will not bear any portion of your losses.

### No brokering transactions or provision of investment advice

We provide an execution-only service. We do not broker transactions on your behalf, advise on the merits of any particular digital assets, transactions, or associated risks, or provide any other financial, investment or legal advice in connection with the Services. To the extent that we do provide trading data, post market commentary, articles, or make social media posts, the act of doing so is incidental to your relationship with us and such information may not be considered as investment or financial advice and should not be construed as such. ANY DECISION TO BUY OR SELL DIGITAL ASSETS IS SOLELY THE USER’S DECISION AND WE WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY CONSEQUENT LOSS.

### No promise of liquidity

The ability for you to buy or sell digital assets on IDEX is contingent on there being a counterparty willing to buy or sell the same digital asset. We make no promises as to the timing or availability of buying or selling digital assets on the Site. We reserve the right to change, suspend, or discontinue any aspect of the Services at any time and in any jurisdiction, without notice and without liability. This includes, without limitation, the absolute discretion to list and de-list digital assets available for trading at any time. We are not required to provide advance notice of delisting.

You acknowledge and agree that digital assets and/or features available in one jurisdiction may not be available for trading or to access, as applicable, in another.

### No guarantee of continuous access to Services

We do not guarantee continuous, uninterrupted or secure access to any part of the Services, and operation of our site may be interfered with by numerous factors outside of our control, including regulatory reasons and issues with the Polygon network. We will make reasonable efforts to ensure that transactions are processed in a timely manner, but we make no representations or warranties regarding the amount of time needed to complete transactions.

## Taxes

It is your responsibility to determine what, if any, taxes apply to the payments you make or receive, and to collect, report, and remit the correct tax to the appropriate tax authority. We will make any tax withholdings or filings that we are required by law to make, but we are not responsible for determining whether taxes apply to your transaction, or for collecting, reporting, or remitting any taxes arising from any transaction. We encourage you to speak with your personal tax advisor regarding the tax implications of your use of the Site and Services.

## Indemnification and Release

DeXter and its subsidiaries, parents, affiliates, service providers, and each of their respective officers, directors, agents, joint venturers, employees or representatives (collectively, the “Released Parties”), are not liable for any damages that may arise out of or in connection with your use of the Services. This includes, but is not limited to, claims, applications, injuries, delays, direct loss, loss of business or profits, business interruption costs, loss of goodwill or business profits, loss of cryptocurrency or digital assets, damage caused by your computer, computer software, systems and programs, and the data thereon or any other direct or indirect, consequential and incidental damages. In addition, the Released Parties are not liable for any losses incurred, either directly or indirectly through your use of the Site or any of its functions and features (collectively, all of the foregoing items shall be referred to herein as “losses”). The Released Parties are hereby released by you from liability for any and all losses. These limitations of liability apply whether the liability or losses are based on negligence, contract, tort, or any other basis, even if the Released Parties had been advised or should have known of the possibility of such losses.

You agree to indemnify and hold the Released Parties harmless from any claim or losses (including attorneys’ fees and any losses, fines, fees, or penalties imposed by any regulatory authority) arising out of your breach of this Agreement, or your violation of any law or regulation.

If you have a dispute with one or more Users, Nodes, issuers of digital assets listed on DeXter or other third-parties, you release the Released Parties from any and all claims, demands, and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes.

## Disclosures and Disclaimer of Warranties
